  app.get('/api/vendor/rfx-invitations', async (req, res) => {
    // Get RFx invitations for current vendor
  });
  
  app.get('/api/vendor/rfx-responses', async (req, res) => {
    // Get vendor's submitted responses
  });
  
  app.post('/api/vendor/rfx-responses', async (req, res) => {
    // Create new RFx response with attachments
  });
  
  app.put('/api/vendor/rfx-responses/:id', async (req, res) => {
    // Update existing response (draft mode)
  });
  ```

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Current Component Architecture (IDENTIFIED)
```
RfxResponseForm (EXISTS - needs enhancement)
├── Basic file upload (EXISTS - needs upgrade to ObjectUploader)
├── Form Fields (EXISTS - working)
├── Terms Acceptance (EXISTS - working)
└── Submission Controls (EXISTS - needs API integration)
```

#### Target Component Architecture
```
RfxResponseForm (ENHANCED)
├── RfxAttachmentManager (NEW)
│   ├── ObjectUploader (EXISTING - reuse)
│   ├── AttachmentList (NEW)
│   └── FilePreview (NEW)
├── Form Fields (EXISTING - keep)
└── SubmissionControls (ENHANCED)
```

#### API Flow (CURRENT vs TARGET)
**CURRENT FLOW (PARTIAL)**:
```
1. Basic file upload → Manual FormData upload
2. Limited file handling → Basic attachment array
3. No proper API integration → Form submission incomplete
```

**TARGET FLOW**:
```
1. User selects files → RfxAttachmentManager
2. Request presigned URLs → POST /api/objects/upload (EXISTS)
3. Upload files to object storage → Direct to GCS (EXISTS)
4. Update attachment metadata → PUT /api/vendor/rfx-responses/:id (NEW)
5. Set ACL policies → ObjectStorageService (EXISTS)
6. Submit response → POST /api/vendor/rfx-responses (NEW)
```

#### Database Schema (Already Present)
```sql
rfx_responses {
  attachments: text[] -- Array of object storage paths
}
```

### File Structure Plan

#### Files to Create:
```
client/src/components/
├── RfxAttachmentManager.tsx        # RFx-specific attachment handler
├── FilePreview.tsx                 # File preview component  
└── AttachmentList.tsx              # Attachment display/management
```

#### Files to Modify (PRIORITY ORDER):

**HIGH PRIORITY** (Core Functionality):
```
server/
├── routes.ts                       # ADD vendor RFx response API endpoints
└── storage.ts                      # ADD vendor response CRUD methods

client/src/components/
└── rfx-response-form.tsx           # UPGRADE file upload, fix API integration

shared/
└── schema.ts                       # ADD missing Zod schemas for vendor responses
```

**MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Enhanced UX):
```
client/src/pages/
├── vendor-portal.tsx               # ENHANCE attachment display
└── rfx-management.tsx              # IMPROVE vendor response workflow
```

**LOW PRIORITY** (Advanced Features):
```
server/
├── objectStorage.ts                # EXTEND for RFx-specific ACL policies
└── fileValidation.ts               # CREATE file validation utilities (NEW)
```

### Current State Analysis (CRITICAL FINDINGS)

#### ✅ WORKING COMPONENTS:
- Object storage infrastructure (`ObjectUploader.tsx`, `TermsUploader.tsx`)
- Database schema with attachments field (`rfxResponses.attachments`)
- Basic response form UI (`rfx-response-form.tsx`)
- Terms acceptance workflow
- Vendor portal navigation

#### ❌ MISSING/INCOMPLETE COMPONENTS:
- **Backend API endpoints** for vendor responses (`/api/vendor/rfx-responses/*`)
- **Storage methods** for vendor response CRUD operations
- **Form submission logic** in response form (API integration incomplete)
- **Multi-file upload** integration (currently basic single file)
- **Response persistence** workflow (draft/final submission)

### Implementation Priority Matrix

**CRITICAL (Must Fix First)**:
1. ❌ **Backend API endpoints** - vendor response CRUD operations missing
2. ❌ **Form submission logic** - RFx response form cannot actually submit
3. ❌ **Storage layer methods** - vendor response persistence incomplete
4. ❌ **API integration** - frontend form not connected to backend

**High Priority (Core Features)**:
1. ✅ **Object storage integration** - infrastructure exists and working
2. ❌ **Multiple file upload** - basic upload exists, needs enhancement
3. ❌ **Response workflow** - vendor can view invitations but cannot respond
4. ❌ **Attachment persistence** - files upload but not saved with response

**Medium Priority (Enhanced UX)**:
1. ❌ **File preview functionality** - need thumbnail/preview system
2. ✅ **Terms acceptance** - workflow exists and working  
3. ❌ **Draft vs final submission** - response states incomplete
4. ❌ **Attachment management** - file removal/editing capabilities

**Low Priority (Advanced Features)**:
1. File scanning/virus detection
2. Advanced file thumbnails
3. File versioning capabilities
4. Collaborative annotations

### Security Considerations

**Access Control**:
- Vendor-uploaded files should have ACL policy: `owner: vendorId, visibility: private`
- Only the uploading vendor and authorized buyers can access files
- Implement role-based access for different user types

**File Validation**:
- Whitelist approved file extensions
- Validate MIME types server-side
- Implement file size limits per file and total per response
- Basic content scanning for security threats

**Storage Management**:
- Automatic cleanup of orphaned files
- Retention policies for completed RFx responses
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**:
- File upload component functionality
- File validation logic
- API endpoint responses
- Database operations

**Integration Tests**:
- End-to-end file upload workflow
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness
- Error handling scenarios

**User Acceptance Tests**:
- Vendor workflow completion
- Buyer file access verification
- Performance under load
- Security penetration testing

### Performance Optimization

**Frontend**:
- Lazy loading of file previews
- Chunked file uploads for large files
- Client-side compression for images
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers

**Backend**:
- Async file processing
- CDN integration for file delivery
- Database indexing for attachment queries
- Caching of file metadata

### Monitoring & Analytics

**Metrics to Track**:
- File upload success rates
- Average file sizes and types
- User engagement with attachment features
- Error rates and failure points

**Alerts**:
- Storage quota approaching limits
- Unusual file upload patterns
- Failed upload attempts
- Security violations

### Migration & Deployment

**Data Migration**:
- No migration needed - `attachments` field already exists
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Gradual rollout possible

**Deployment Steps**:
1. Deploy backend API changes
2. Update frontend components
3. Run integration tests
4. Monitor initial usage
5. Gather user feedback
6. Iterate based on feedback

## Critical Implementation Blockers Identified

### 🚨 **MAJOR ISSUE**: Vendor Response Workflow Incomplete

**Problem**: The vendor response system has a **fundamental gap** - vendors cannot actually submit responses despite having a form interface.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Missing Backend APIs**: No `/api/vendor/rfx-responses` endpoints exist in `server/routes.ts`
2. **Incomplete Storage Layer**: Vendor response CRUD methods missing from `server/storage.ts`  
3. **Broken Form Submission**: `rfx-response-form.tsx` has submission logic but no working API endpoint
4. **Attachment Persistence Gap**: Files upload to object storage but not saved with response record

### 🔧 **Immediate Fix Required**

**Before any file attachment enhancements**, we must fix the core vendor response workflow:

1. **Create Backend API endpoints** for vendor responses
2. **Implement Storage methods** for response CRUD operations
3. **Fix Form submission logic** to connect frontend to backend
4. **Test end-to-end workflow** from invitation to response submission

**Only after this foundation is solid** should we enhance the file attachment system.

## Revised Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: **Fix Core Response Workflow** (CRITICAL - 2-3 hours)
- Implement missing vendor response API endpoints
- Add storage methods for response persistence  
- Fix form submission integration
- Test basic response submission (without multiple attachments)

### Phase 2: **Enhance File Attachments** (1-2 hours)
- Upgrade to multiple file upload using existing ObjectUploader
- Implement attachment persistence with responses
- Add file management capabilities

### Phase 3: **Polish & Advanced Features** (1-2 hours)
- File previews, validation, security enhancements
- Vendor portal improvements
- Error handling and user experience polish

**Estimated Timeline**: 4-7 hours total development time
**Risk Level**: Medium (requires fixing existing broken functionality)
**User Impact**: **CRITICAL** (enables core vendor response capability)

### Recommendation

**START WITH PHASE 1** - The vendor response workflow must work before adding file attachment enhancements. This ensures we build on a solid foundation and deliver working functionality incrementally.

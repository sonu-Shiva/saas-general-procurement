# SCLEN Procurement Platform

## Overview
This project is a modern, full-stack procurement management platform designed to streamline and enhance procurement processes. It features a React frontend and a Django REST API backend, offering comprehensive tools for managing vendors, products, RFx processes, auctions, and purchase orders. The platform incorporates AI-powered features and real-time capabilities to provide a complete and efficient solution for procurement needs. The business vision is to provide an innovative platform that simplifies complex procurement workflows, improves transparency, and drives efficiency for businesses, positioning itself as a leader in digital procurement solutions.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Code quality priority: Zero tolerance for regression issues - existing functionality must always be preserved.
Development approach: Comprehensive testing and validation before any changes to prevent breaking working features.

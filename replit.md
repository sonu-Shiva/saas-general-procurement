The business vision is to provide an innovative platform that simplifies complex procurement workflows, improves transparency, and drives efficiency for businesses, positioning itself as a leader in digital procurement solutions.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Code quality priority: Zero tolerance for regression issues - existing functionality must always be preserved.
Development approach: Comprehensive testing and validation before any changes to prevent breaking working features.

## Recent Changes

### Regression Prevention & Code Quality (January 5, 2025)
- **CRITICAL LESSON**: Regression issues caused by incomplete API signature updates across codebase
- **ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED**: Schema import mismatches, method name inconsistencies, incomplete refactoring
- **PREVENTION MEASURES**: Comprehensive validation system, TypeScript strict checking, systematic refactoring protocols
- **QUALITY GATES**: Added pre-deployment validation checks, interface consistency verification
- **USER PRIORITY**: Zero tolerance for regression issues - all changes must maintain existing functionality

### Vendor Portal Architecture Fix (August 5, 2025)
- **CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED**: Fixed major architectural routing problem where vendors were accessing buyer's RFx Management instead of vendor portal
- **ROUTING FIXED**: Added dedicated /vendor-portal route and updated sidebar navigation to route vendors correctly
- **5-STATE SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED**: Successfully implemented simplified status system (ACTIVE, RESPONDED, CANCELLED, PO GENERATED) 
- **DATA STRUCTURE ADAPTED**: Fixed vendor portal to work with flat data structure (rfxStatus, rfxDueDate, etc.)
- **RUNTIME ERRORS ELIMINATED**: Resolved all undefined property access errors that were crashing the vendor interface
- **VENDOR PORTAL FUNCTIONAL**: Vendors now access dedicated portal showing proper status badges instead of "INVITED"

### Product Category Management Fix (August 5, 2025)
- **FIXED**: Missing PUT endpoint for category updates - editing categories now works perfectly
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Hierarchical numbering system - categories now use "1", "1.1", "1.1.1", "1.1.1.1" format
- **AUTOMATED**: Server-side code generation - automatically creates proper hierarchical codes based on parent-child relationships
- **RESOLVED**: Category creation and update API endpoints properly validated with Zod schemas
- **CONFIRMED**: Both create and update operations working with proper JSON responses and hierarchical structure

### Product Catalogue Regression Fix (January 5, 2025)
- **FIXED**: Schema import errors in server/routes.ts (removed non-existent imports like auctionBids, purchaseOrderItems)
- **CORRECTED**: Method name mismatch getProductCategoriesHierarchy â†’ getProductCategoryHierarchy
- **RESOLVED**: API request function signature mismatches across all components
- **RESTORED**: Product catalogue display functionality - 6 products now showing correctly
- **TESTED**: Role switching functionality working without breaking other features

### Vendor Management Bug Fixes (January 5, 2025)
- **FIXED**: Vendor delete and remove functionality regression issues
- **RESOLVED**: Missing DELETE and PATCH API endpoints for vendor operations
- **CORRECTED**: Database storage method returning wrong result format for delete operations
- **TESTED**: Both "Remove Vendor" (status update) and "Delete Vendor" (permanent removal) working correctly
- **IMPROVED**: Added proper vendor existence validation before update/delete operations

### AI Discovery Integration (January 2025)
- **FULLY RESOLVED**: Complete AI vendor discovery with real contact information (January 5, 2025)
- **COMPLETED**: Fixed Perplexity API integration with correct "sonar-pro" model
- **WORKING**: Real phone numbers (e.g., +91-80-2674 2322) and email addresses (e.g., info@srindus.com) fully functional
- **CONFIRMED**: AI search matches Google search quality with complete vendor contact details including phone and email
- **TESTED**: Contact parsing logic fixed - both email and phone number extraction working correctly
- Implemented development authentication bypass for testing core functionality
